# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to build an interactive webpage where the webpage user could enter search paramaters that would then filter the data to that specific filter parameter.  The filters include the following: date, city, state, country, and shape.

#### Using the Filter Search

Using the deliverable is very simple.  All the use needs to do is enter in the desired parameters into the input boxes shown above.  The user can enter in multiple parameters or just one, the data will only be filtered by the input boxes that were changed.  Once all the inputs have been entered by the user, pressing the enter button will prompt the browser to update the table to match results to the user search criteria.  This is a very simple piece of software to use!

## Summary

* One major drawback of this webpage is that the search filters are case sensitive.  This could create problems for the as the country search term "US" would render no results, while "us" is the term that would exactly match the data in the table.  This would be an extremely easy fix in the two functions that were created in our app.js file.
* One possible improvement would be a drop down menu for each field.   This would eliminate the guesswork of the user if they just wanted to explore possible search parameters within the dataset.  Since there are a limited number of search terms for each category it would make it easier to now the scope of the dataset if there was a drop down menu.  Another improvement would be to update the text within the table to be capitilized properly.  This would just provide a cleaner and professional look to the table.
